#### Sessions and Cookies

Recall that HTTP servers need to be able to recognize clients from one another. They do this through sessions and cookies.

Answer the following questions about sessions and cookies:

15. Which response header sends a cookie to the client?

16. Which request header will continue the client's session?
    * Cookie: 
    
    ```HTTP
    GET /cart HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.org
    Cookie: cart=Bob
    ```
